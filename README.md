Minimum Labelling Spanning Tree

In this work we solve the problem of Minimum labelling spanning tree (MLSP). The idea of this problem are build a tree using 
minimum different labels that is possible (weights of the edges). To solve this problem we use VNS (variable neighbourhood search).
The results obtained with this work are compared with the results obtained by [Consoli et al. 2009]. The result can be seen in an
article that stays in the folder named resources.
